This repository contains course materials for my 1-Day Excel course in 2023 aimed at young GP / Family Medicine intern doctors.

In order to simulate a real GP's office, I created a **fake patient list** with >1600 patients by scraping various websites for data (among which the Portuguese 2021 Census website) and carefully modeling it to match the real statistical distribution in Portugal of parameters such as age, gender, family size and home region. Each patient was assigned a fake National Health System number and a fake first and last name also matching the current name distribution in Portugal.

This made it possible for the students to work on realistic-looking data sets just like they would with their (real) patient lists, without risking compromising patients' anonymity and privacy.

Later exercises included scraping data from real and fake websites, fake laboratory results, fake diagnosis, fake biometric data, a fake database for a scientific paper and a fake CV.

Included in this repository are also the program, the initial PPT introduction and the first few chapters of the course manual I wrote in Obsidian.

**Please note** that later chapters and course exercises are not included in this public repo as they take a more practical / hands-on approach and require careful explanation in-loco.

All available files are free to be used non-commercially as long as you link back to this repo wherever you use them.
